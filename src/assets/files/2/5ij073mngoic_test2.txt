New Cairo (Arabic: القاهرة الجديدة el-Qāhera el-Gedīda) is a satellite city within the Cairo Governorate of Egypt, and the metropolitan area of Greater Cairo. Administratively, it is officially part of the Eastern Area of Cairo city,[2] but like all new settlements in Egypt, it is directly governed by the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA).[3] The city was established in 2000 as part of Egypt's strategic effort to alleviate the chronic congestion of Greater Cairo by decentralising population and economic activity.[4] The city is made up of a mix of residential neighbourhoods, commercial centres, and institutional zones. It is home to several gated communities, private universities, malls, international schools, and corporate headquarters, positioning it as a hub for Cairo’s upper and elite classes. Its development reflects Egypt’s broader neoliberal urban planning strategies, aimed at attracting private investments and promoting modern and western lifestyles.[4]

According to the 2017 census, New Cairo's three qisms had a combined population of 297,387 residents (also see population section below).[5][6] The city could eventually host a population of 5 million.[7] When compared to 6th of October, also built with the hopes of alleviating the strain on Cairo, more homes are being rented out in New Cairo.[8]

New Cairo has attracted both praise and criticism. While it is seen as a model for modern urban expansion, it is also scrutinised for social exclusivity and limited accessibility for lower-income classes.[9]

History
The expansion of Cairo follows a long history of elite-led urban development in Egypt, beginning with 19-century modernisation projects under Mohammed Ali and Khedive Ismail, who sought to emulate European cities like Paris to help Egypt gain international recognition.[citation needed] The newly developed suburbs in the early 20th century, like Heliopolis and Maadi, were constructed for the elite and European citizens living in the city at the time.[citation needed] After the 1952 revolution, in which the pro-Western monarchy was overthrown fuelled by Egyptian nationalism, a new urban vision emerged to symbolise the passing of the colonial era. The new republic established Gamal Abdel Nasser as its president, who created public spaces to as the Nile corniche to reclaim Cairo from its colonial past.[10] Cairo’s landscape underwent great transformations as the government, undertook large-scale socialist housing projects to provide affordable housing to newly arrived immigrants. However, as the demographic grew rapidly as a result of industrialisation, the government struggled to control the growth and expansion of the city.[11]

As the population continued to grow throughout the late 50s, rising land prices pushed lower- and middle Egyptians to settle informally on the outskirt of Cairo, into the desert onto privately owned agricultural land without official authorisation due to their affordability. This trend accelerated, and by 1990 the informal settlements housed nearly two-thirds of Cairo’s population. Despite their significance, successive governments largely overlooked these districts.[12] The failure to provide adequate low-income housing was compounded by the economic liberalisation policies of the infitah era, which led to the continuous devaluation of the Egyptian pound and a stark decline is its purchasing power. Families sought alternative housing in graveyards, rooftop shacks, garages, and shared apartments. Cairo’s environmental conditions degraded, and became marked by visual chaos, polluted streets, and risen noise levels.[13]

The Rise of New Cairo

The deteriorating conditions in central Cairo once again prompted an interest in desert expansion for the upper class. The state actively facilitated this shift by privatising desert land with real estate developers, creating new financial and investment opportunities. The city’s function shifted from a site of social reproduction to a space shaped by entrepreneurialism, market-oriented production, and consumerist lifestyles.[13] Dozens of luxury compounds were constructed on Cairo’s outskirts, featuring golf courses, private universities, shopping malls, simulating an idealised urban lifestyle. The appeal of New Cairo was enhanced by the degradation of public space in the old city, from traffic and pollution to overcrowding.[9]

Urban planners characterised this transformation as a form of gentrification, as before the development of New Cairo, the area was home to three informal settlements housing poor families and the unhoused. These communities were later displaced, as the land was sold off to private investors.[14] Although New Cairo was envisioned as a city akin to Heliopolis, housing all social classes, the dominance of private interest turned the area into a symbol of exclusion, reinforcing Cairo’s socio-spatial inequalities.

Administrative subdivisions and population
New Cairo, like most new cities in Egypt, is not administratively a city under Local Administration Law, rather a group of three qisms (police wards) attached to the Eastern Area of Cairo proper: Al-Qahira al-Gadida Awwal, Thani, and Thalith (New Cairo 1st, 2nd, and 3rd).[2] New Cairo is jointly administered by the Ministry of Housing's New Urban Communities Authority through a subsidiary agency (gehaz al-Qahira al-Gadida), and Cairo Governorate.

According to the 2017 census New Cairo's three qisms had a combined population of 297,387 residents:[5][6] This is in stark contrast to the New Urban Communities Authority's (NUCA) undated population estimate of 1.5 million inhabitants and a target population of 4 million inhabitants.[15] However, the same source contradicts this claim where it states 70,000 homes as built,[15] leading to an impossibly high average of 21 people per home. The lower population figure translates into a more realistic 4 people per home.

Geography
New Cairo is built in the Eastern Desert to the east of the Cairo Ring Road and the modern 1950s extension of Nasr City, on a plateau that ranges in elevation between 250 and 307 metres (820 and 1,007 ft) above sea level.[16] It was created to comprise three towns (The First, Third, and Fifth settlements),[17] originally on an area of about 67,000 acres which had grown to 85,000 acres by 2016.[3] In 2024, it had expanded further to 99,814 acres.[18] The Petrified Forest Protected Area is of particular significance to geologists, located south of New Cairo. It is a protected site.[19]
